# Privacy Policy for custom GPTs authored by Jae W. Lee

**Last updated:** May 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes, at a high level, how information may be processed when you interact with custom GPTs authored by **Jae W. Lee** (the “Author”) and made available through third-party AI platforms (the “Platforms”).

This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only and does not create any contract, legal right, or legal obligation between you and the Author. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Author disclaims any responsibility or liability relating to your use of the Platforms, the custom GPTs, or any third-party services they rely on.

By using a custom GPT authored by the Author, you acknowledge that your information may be processed by the Platforms and by third-party services in accordance with their own, separate privacy policies.

---

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies only to custom GPT configurations, prompts, and logic authored by the Author and made available on one or more third-party Platforms.

It **does not** apply to:

* The Platforms themselves or any underlying AI models and infrastructure.
* Third-party services integrated into or used by the custom GPTs (including but not limited to Sheetlabs and Google).
* Any websites or applications you access via links, outputs, or content generated by the custom GPTs (for example, external URLs returned as part of answers).

Those services have their own privacy policies and terms, which govern their collection and use of your information. You should review those documents directly, including:

* Sheetlabs’ Privacy Policy ([sheetlabs.com][1])
* Google’s Privacy Policy ([Google Policies][2])

The Author does **not** control, operate, or manage these third-party services and is **not responsible** for their practices.

---

## 2. Data Sources Used by the Custom GPTs

The custom GPTs may use:

* Publicly available information; and/or
* Data sources that the Author, or the relevant data provider, has the rights to use for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes.

The Author does not intentionally configure custom GPTs to access or use private data sources for which there is no right of use. However, the Author does not independently verify all data that a Platform may access or process and cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or legality of any data provided by others or by the Platforms themselves.

---

## 3. Information You Provide via the Platforms

When you interact with a custom GPT (for example, by typing messages, uploading files, or providing URLs), the information you provide is sent directly to the Platform and processed by the Platform and/or its model providers.

Depending on how you use the custom GPT and how the Platform is configured, information you provide may include:

* Text, prompts, and questions you enter.
* Files or structured data you upload or authorize the Platform or third-party services to read.
* Technical and usage information collected by the Platform (such as IP address, device, browser, timestamps, etc.), as determined by the Platform’s own systems.

The Author does **not** operate the Platform’s infrastructure, does not control how the Platform logs or stores this information, and does not guarantee or oversee the Platform’s security measures.

Your interaction data may also be processed by third-party services (such as Sheetlabs or Google) to fulfill specific features of a custom GPT, in accordance with those services’ own privacy policies. ([sheetlabs.com][1])

## 4. How Information May Be Used

### 4.1 Use by the Platform and Third Parties

Information you provide to the custom GPT may be used by:

* The Platform, in accordance with its own privacy policy and terms of use (for example, for providing responses, maintaining service quality, security, or improving models, as applicable).
* Sheetlabs, where the GPT uses Sheetlabs APIs to access datasets or spreadsheets, in accordance with Sheetlabs’ own policies. ([sheetlabs.com][1])
* Google, where the GPT uses Google services or data sources (for example, Google Sheets, Maps, or other APIs) in accordance with Google’s own policies. ([Google Policies][2])

The Author does not determine or control these uses and is not responsible for them.

### 4.2 Use by the Author

To the extent that the Author may access aggregated or limited information (for example, usage statistics, anonymized logs made available by the Platform), that information may be used to:

* Understand how custom GPTs are used in general.
* Improve prompts, configuration, and behavior of the GPTs.
* Diagnose issues or abuse at a high level.

The Author does **not** intend to use information from custom GPTs to personally identify users, unless required to do so under applicable law or by a lawful request from an authority.

The Author does **not** make independent commitments regarding:

* Storing or retaining identifiable personal data from your interactions.
* Responding to individual data subject requests (such as access, correction, deletion) except to the extent strictly required by applicable law and technically supported by the Platform.

You should direct privacy-related requests primarily to the Platform and relevant third-party service providers.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Custom GPTs may rely on or interact with third-party services, including but not limited to:

* **Sheetlabs**, which may process data sent via API calls to or from spreadsheets or structured datasets. Sheetlabs describes its data collection, usage, and retention practices in its privacy policy: [sheetlabs.com](https://sheetlabs.com/privacy).
* **Google services**, such as Google Sheets or other APIs, which process data under Google’s Privacy Policy: [Google Policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy).


These third-party services may collect and process personal information, usage data, and logs in ways that are independent of the Author and are governed exclusively by the third parties’ own policies and contracts.

The Author does not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for:

* The content, security, or availability of any third-party service.
* Any personal information collected, processed, or shared by those services.

Your use of those services is solely at your own risk and subject to their own terms.

---

## 6. Data Security

The infrastructure, storage, and technical security for your interactions with custom GPTs are provided by the Platform and the relevant third-party services.

The Author:

* Does **not** operate the servers or networks used to process your data.
* Does **not** guarantee the security of any transmission or storage of data by the Platform or third parties.
* Is **not** responsible for any security incident, breach, unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure occurring on or through the Platform or third-party services.

You should review the security and privacy documentation of the Platform and any third-party services you use, and you should avoid sharing sensitive personal information with the custom GPTs unless you fully understand and accept those risks.

---

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion

Data retention and deletion are primarily controlled by:

* The Platform on which the custom GPT runs.
* Any third-party services (such as Sheetlabs or Google) that receive data as part of your use of the custom GPT.

The Author does not independently guarantee:

* How long any Platform or third-party service retains data.
* That any specific item of data can or will be deleted upon request.
* That backups or logs maintained by third parties will be erased.

You should consult the Platform’s and third-party services’ privacy policies and procedures for information about retention and deletion, and direct any such requests to them.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The custom GPTs are not designed or intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or any higher age required by applicable law in your jurisdiction). The Author does not intentionally target or knowingly collect personal information from children. Any controls relating to age, access, and parental consent are the responsibility of the Platform and the account holder.

If you believe a child has provided personal information via the Platform in connection with a custom GPT, you should contact the Platform directly to request appropriate action.

---

## 9. International Data Transfers

The Platforms and third-party services (including Sheetlabs and Google) may process and store data on servers located in multiple jurisdictions. ([sheetlabs.com][1])

The Author does not choose or control where your data is processed or stored. Any international transfers, cross-border data flows, or localization measures are governed by the policies and technical designs of the Platform and the relevant third-party services.
